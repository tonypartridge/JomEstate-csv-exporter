# JomEstate-csv-exporter
This is a simple script which connects to the JomEstate Database and does an export, prepared for OS Property for Joomla!

It became clear to us that JomEstate was handling things is quite a bad way it massively impacted our SEO. For example, having 14,000 redirects over 38,000 urls becuase of the way images are called and redirects.
Also V3.7 and prior have a very high SQL Injection vulnerability.
